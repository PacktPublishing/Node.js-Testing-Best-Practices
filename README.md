# Node.js-Testing-Best-Practices
Node.js Testing Best Practices, published by [Packt]

This is the code repository for Node.js Testing Best Practices, published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## Prerequisites:
* built with NodeJS 12.6 (may work with lower versions, but not tested)  


## Usage:
* clone the whole repository to disk, or download the zip
* run "npm install" in each directory
* run "npm test" in each of the directories to run the tests

### Some specific examples require launching something first:
* In 3.4 there is a runsrv.bat file that runs the json-server, which has to be installed globally (npm i -g json-server)
* In 4.1 there is a run.bat file in each directory (frontEnd and backEnd)
